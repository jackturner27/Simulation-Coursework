# Simulation-Coursework
Here is a repository of all the code I used in my simulation courswork. This was coded in Eclipse so there may be leftover project files. 


Noteworthy Experiments

Airfoil - An experiment into the airflow over an airfoil and how the angle of attack affects the resulting drag and lift.

SimpleFourStateCA - An experiment involving running a four state cellualar automata.

FFT - An application of the Fast Fourier Transform onto an 2D image.

LBM - A fluid simulation, experimenting with incoming fluid moving around a circular obstacle.
